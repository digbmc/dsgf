# Overall Updates since last DSGF

I did make some progress since last time but not as tangible as I would like. I did watch some videos from Video Script Writing https://www.linkedin.com/learning/video-script-writing/welcome?resume=false&u=76958498 which was recommended by Christine Boyland. I also found that Canaday library has a greenscreen A/V room with Soundproofing which I believe after watching this Video Script Writing videos, that I may utilize in order to help visualize or discuss concepts of Vibrating Sample Magnetometry. However I was not able to start writing the script as My research Advisor has put me on a new project which required a lot of my time.

## Tangible Steps

Watched Video Script Scriting in order to better organize my ideas around an actual script so it is easier to manage the time in a 5 minute video (Which is what my research advisor would like for our lab group)

### Plan Going Forward

Next semester I will not be A TA where I have to attend every class, and my research will be more clear and familiar now that I have learned the Vibrating Sample Magnetometer and done measurements. I effectively won't be learning the instrument and trying to write about it at the same time. I will be in a better position to begin working on this video and getting feedback from May and Christine Boyland. Between Family Emergencies and TAing one of the hardest physics classes in the curriculum, I was inundated and unable to meet as much tangible objectives. I appreciate your patience and still believe that I can put the skills and workshop to at the very least come up with a script which I now know more about from watching the video course Video Script Writing.
