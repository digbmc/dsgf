# SMART Goals for DGSF
## Specific
Produce a story map documenting the physical travel of a) St. Luke icons and b) texts that discuss St. Luke icons from the Mediterranean region to Ethiopia in the late Middle Ages.
## Measurable
A full story map will be comeplete by the end of the year. Intermittent goals include:
1. Completing the necessary tutorials to navigate ARCGIS.
2. Determine relevant sites and find their geographic coordinates.
3. Determine how to represent historic political boundaries.
4. Complete a basemap to use in the final story map.
## Achievable
Tutorials will familiarize me with ARCGIS, and I will consult with Tessa and Alice when specific problems arise. This will ensure I have the skills and familiarity with the software to achieve my desired outcome.
## Relevant
This project is a new approach to the research questions I present in my master's thesis. I hope that mapping will allow me to think visually about my research and offer a new way into the material.
## Timebound
The final deliverable will be complete by the end of the year. I will consult with Alice and Jeff on workflow while in Ä°stanbul. This may require a faster-paced schedule in the Fall Semester, or Zoom check-ins to ensure I am making progress while abroad.
### By Monday, October 20
Complete ARCGIS tutorials on [mapping](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/paths/cartographic-creations-with-web-maps/) and [storymaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/d34681ac0d1a417894a3a3d955c6913f?item=2). Consult with Tessa and Alice on problem areas.
### By Monday, October 3
Identify which sites will be on the map and collect their coordinates. Enter location data in CSV file and create an unstyled base map.
### By Monday, November 10
Explore possibilities for representing historical political boundaries. Use resources like [Harvard's Geospatial Library](https://hgl.harvard.edu/), or draw boundaries myself with vectors. Consult with Tessa and Alice if needed.
### By Monday, November 24
Style basemap with labels, custom icons, etc.
### By end of Fall Semester: Friday, December 19
Final basemap due.
### By end of year, Friday, May 15
  Final storymap due.
