# Update 11/23

## Mapping progress

I have been researching ways to represent historical geo-political boundaries in ArcGIS online and have produced a [temporary solution](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b87d035d6d864946ab5e09c2e4937f02). I used a sketch layer to draw the boundaries by hand. This is a rather unscientific solution, so I plan to continue exploring other solutions. One is to import geospatial data using a [shape file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile#:~:text=The%20shapefile%20format%20is%20a,and%20other%20GIS%20software%20products.).

## Next steps

Because I have the points and styling that I need for my story map, I plan to move forward with that part of the project. I will also continue looking into shape files as a way to develop a map for future conference presentations and articles.
