    "section": "",
    "text": "SMART Goal\n\nSpecific\nCreate an informational video for using the Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) that is informative, interesting and generates enthusiasm for what we do in the Nanomaterials and Spintronics Lab at QMSEC (Quantum Materials, Sensing and Education Center.)\n\n\nMeasurable\nWhat “data” will you use to measure your goal or to determine if it has been met?\n  I am fortunate to have the guidance of my exceptional research advisor, Dr. Xuemei May Cheng, and the valuable insights of Christine Boyland. Christine has kindly shared her expertise on video storytelling and showed me some techiques through WeVideo so far. Furthermore, I have the benefit of a diverse lab community consisting of individuals with varying age ranges and educational backgrounds—including undergraduates and graduates—who I believe would be willing to offer their feedback as well.\nIf this is a long term goal, what milestones (or sub-goals) will you need to meet on the way to achieving it? What “data” will you use to measure your goal or to determine if it has been met?\n  Subgoal 1: Before proceeding with the video, I will ensure that my advisor approves the Standard Operating Procedure I’ve been developing. This document incorporates helpful visuals and critical information but still requires some refinement. Obtaining my advisor’s feedback will guarantee that I am accurately demonstrating each step and setting a strong example for viewers. Although I’m still fairly new to operating the VSM, it will be my primary measurement equipment in the lab until December, so this video project provides an excellent opportunity to further refine my skills and knowledge.\n  Subgoal 2: I need to make a video and have Christine look at it and approve it. It needs to be an easier project so I can start to confirm I’ve gotten some of the technical details and nuances of video production.\n  Subgoal 3: I need to understand lighting and recording on site in my lab to get the best video. This will require working more with Christine and fleshing out my ideas.\n  Subgoal 4: Work on off camera narration and footage. I will want to explain some of the physics principles and narrate them. Example “VSM employs Faraday’s law….VSM measures (among other things) Hysteresis loops   they are….etc.\n  Subgoal 5: Record one segment of the video, maybe scenes of mounting the sample to be included in the full 5 minute video.\n  Subgoal 6: Narrate a fast-forwarded hysteresis loop going over the various parts and why they are important to our magnetic characterization of materials.   ##### Achievable\nCan you reasonably accomplish the goal? Do you have the necessary skills or resources? What “data” will you use to measure your goal or to determine if it has been met?\n Yes, I think this is a reasonable goal as I will be working with the VSM frequently in the lab and I have good experienced people to both advise me and also give me feedback. I do not currently have the video production skills but I have Christine Boyland and I can benefit from her experience. She has also already introduced me to software and instructional videos. I Just need to watch them and apply their lessons in a tangible way.\n  ##### Relevant\nDoes this particular goal align with broader project or personal goals? How is the outcome important?    Absolutely, creating this video will not only deepen my understanding of the VSM—a crucial tool for characterizing our samples and unraveling their magnetic properties—but also pique my personal interest in video production. As a consumer of YouTube content, I’m excited to explore this medium, particularly to share my experiences as someone with ADHD and spatial reasoning challenges who has successfully pursued a PhD in physics. By sharing my journey, I hope to inspire others who might face similar obstacles. Ultimately, I aim to create a valuable resource for future lab members, as well as high school students curious about the hands-on reality of scientific research. This goal is important to me because I want to contribute to the growth and support of the next generation of scientists.\n\n\nTime Bound\nWhat is the time frame for accomplishing the goal? Is it realistic?    I would like the timeframe to be by the conclusion of our program DSGF but I can also try to make it by the end of December if that is too late. I think towards the end of DSGF is more realistic as I will be much more skilled and proficient (and confidant) in executing the VSM by then but I will also be working throughout the Fall primarily on VSM measurement and data analysis specifically (at least this is the current goal of my research advisor.)"

Determine how to represent historic political boundaries. 4. Complete a basemap to use in the final story map. ## Achievable Tutorials will familiarize me with ARCGIS, and I will consult with Tessa and Alice when specific problems arise. This will ensure I have the skills and familiarity with the software to achieve my desired outcome. ## Relevant This project is a new approach to the research questions I present in my master’s thesis. I hope that mapping will allow me to think visually about my research and offer a new way into the material. ## Timebound The final deliverable will be complete by the end of the year. I will consult with Alice and Jeff on workflow while in İstanbul. This may require a faster-paced schedule in the Fall Semester, or Zoom check-ins to ensure I am making progress while abroad. ### By Monday, October 20 Complete ARCGIS tutorials on mapping and storymaps. Consult with Tessa and Alice on problem areas. ### By Monday, October 3 Identify which sites will be on the map and collect their coordinates. Enter location data in CSV file and create an unstyled base map. ### By Monday, November 10 Explore possibilities for representing historical political boundaries. Use resources like Harvard’s Geospatial Library, or draw boundaries myself with vectors. Consult with Tessa and Alice if needed. ### By Monday, November 24 Style basemap with labels, custom icons, etc. ### By end of Fall Semester: Friday, December 19 Final basemap due. ### By end of year, Friday, May 15 Final storymap due."
