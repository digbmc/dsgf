# 04. Computational Thinking	

2025.12.03

## Agenda
1. Updates & sharing SMART goals
2. Discussion: How Computers Work
3. [Introduction to the Command Line Workshop](https://digbmc.github.io/command-line/)

## Meeting notes
Note-taker: Jeff 

### Updates & SMART Goals
- Charlie: They have made progress on their shape file for ancient political boundaries. The borders are hand-drawn, however, so they want to find something more precise.
- Jennifer: She hasn't had as much time for working on the project. However, she has watched videos from Chris Boyland and creating videos. As a result, she feels more prepared to start with video-making next semster when she'll have more time.

### Command line
- Jennifer & Charlie both have limited experience using command line, but it's limited.
- Knowing how to use command line opens up a wider world of specialized software packages that people have developed without dealing with a Graphic User Interface (GUI)
- Alice emphasizes that learning command line also helps someone better understand file structures on their computer.

#### Command line resources

- [Introduction to the Command Line Workshop](https://digbmc.github.io/command-line/), Tri-Co DSRI adapted from DHRI @ CUNY.
- [Introduction to the Bash Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash), Ian Milligan and James Baker, The Programming Historian
- Software Carpentry's [tutorial on the Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) (for more advanced tutorials, see the “Loops” and “Shell Scripts” sections)
- [Terminus command line game](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html) (a fantasy choose-your-own adventure like game) (good for getting use to navigating file structures--uses only a few commands)

## Action items

- [ ] Command line follow-up
  - [ ] Finish going through the [Command Line Tutorial](https://digbmc.github.io/command-line/) & post any questions to Slack
  - [ ] Optional: look at the other command line resources
- [ ] Logs
  - [ ] Write up your SMART Goal(s) and add them to your log document
  - [ ] Add a progress update to your log by Wednesday morning before our next session
- [ ] General Reminders
  - [ ] Set up a meeting with Alice or Jeff via [Zoom Scheduler]([https://scheduler.zoom.us/digital-scholarship/dsgf-consultation-meeting](https://brynmawr-edu.zoom.us/zbook/digital-scholarship/dsgf-consultation-meeting) if you need any help.
