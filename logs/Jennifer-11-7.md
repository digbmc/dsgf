# Pverall Updates since last DSGF

I unfortunately have not made much tangible progress since our last meeting. My research advisor had suddenly mentioned the American Physical Society (APS) March Summit was March 15-20 2026, and we were to write an abstract due October 23rd. It was my first APS abstract that I had to write, I had to come up with my own travel budget and arrange to present in Denver Colorado, I've never done that before. On top of that I had two family emergencies including my uncle contracting stage 4 cancer.

## Tangible Steps

I have however made more measurements with the VSM (Vibrating Sample Magnetometry) and am nearly finished with my Standard Operating Procedure which my research advisor wants to approve before we can start talking about the video. I plan to have her look at it next week. I have worked with the undergraduates and gotten some of their feedback for my understanding and teaching about the VSM. I also did get my equipment, I just haven't opened it up and began trying to film with it.

### Plan Going Forward

I need to really put more tangible deadlines going forward and touch base again with Christine Boyland about the video editing process. I'm very sorry that I was derailed this past month. It has been a very hard month both in terms of workload and emotionally. I will try to look at the project management slides again and reassess how I'm fitting in this video with everything else.
