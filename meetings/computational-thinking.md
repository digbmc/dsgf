- Software Carpentry's [tutorial on the Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) (for more advanced tutorials, see the “Loops” and “Shell Scripts” sections)
- [Terminus command line game](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html) (a fantasy choose-your-own adventure like game) (good for getting use to navigating file structures--uses only a few commands)
