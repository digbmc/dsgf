## Instructions for adding a log entry

- Log in to GitHub and navigate to the `logs` folder: [https://github.com/digbmc/dsgf/tree/main/logs](https://github.com/digbmc/dsgf/tree/main/logs)
- Select Add file -> Create new file. Give it a filename that is unique and ends with the suffix '.md' (for markdown): e.g. 'alice-learning-plan.md'
- Give your log a yaml header that includes your name, the date, and a title

    ```yaml
    title: My update
    date: 2025.09.17
    author: Alice
    ```
- Follow the [markdown guide](../resources/markdown-guide.md) for formatting. For advanced features, please see the [authoring section of the Quarto guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).
- Once your post is deployed, you will see your entry below.
