### Mapping & GIS

[Digital Mapping: ArcGIS Online and Experience Builder slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10C-PM1MsA3OE7sdZkoTwcgIpTirjRES_g8FHj3ECr8w/edit?slide=id.g39e2d56a400_0_132#slide=id.g39e2d56a400_0_132)
- Non-technological points
    - Cartography is the science of map making.
    - Key principles of sucessful cartograpy: clarity, consistency, & simplicity
    - Map-making = making choices about what spatial information to highlight or minimize
- Technological points:
    - Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Technology used to create, manage, store, analyze, and map data. It's a digital means of doing         cartography.
    - ArcGIS: one of the most popular GIS platforms available. It is a paid service, but you have complimentary access [at this link](https://brynmawrcollege.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html)
    - ArcGIS will let you build several different types of maps using its component apps. Consult the presentations for information on how to use them:
        - StoryMaps: for narrative-driven mapping experiences where you want to guide users through information
        - Experience Builder: if you want to build your own app experience for users
        - Dashboard: for when you also want to display the underlying data in a map (e.g., how stats change over time0
        - Instant Apps: if you want to use app tempaltes to create your user experience (e.g., creating an image gallery)
    - Once finished, you can use ArcGIS to publish your map.
- Contact information and tutorials: look to [the end of the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10C-PM1MsA3OE7sdZkoTwcgIpTirjRES_g8FHj3ECr8w/edit?slide=id.g39d6f03ac0c_0_406#slide=id.g39d6f03ac0c_0_406) for this info!
