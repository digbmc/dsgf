    "section": "",
    "text": "SMART Goal\n\nSpecific\nCreate an informational video for using the Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) that is informative, interesting and generates enthusiasm for what we do in the Nanomaterials and Spintronics Lab at QMSEC (Quantum Materials, Sensing and Education Center.)\n\n\nMeasurable\nWhat “data” will you use to measure your goal or to determine if it has been met?\n  I am fortunate to have the guidance of my exceptional research advisor, Dr. Xuemei May Cheng, and the valuable insights of Christine Boyland. Christine has kindly shared her expertise on video storytelling and showed me some techiques through WeVideo so far. Furthermore, I have the benefit of a diverse lab community consisting of individuals with varying age ranges and educational backgrounds—including undergraduates and graduates—who I believe would be willing to offer their feedback as well.\nIf this is a long term goal, what milestones (or sub-goals) will you need to meet on the way to achieving it? What “data” will you use to measure your goal or to determine if it has been met?\n  Subgoal 1: Before proceeding with the video, I will ensure that my advisor approves the Standard Operating Procedure I’ve been developing. This document incorporates helpful visuals and critical information but still requires some refinement. Obtaining my advisor’s feedback will guarantee that I am accurately demonstrating each step and setting a strong example for viewers. Although I’m still fairly new to operating the VSM, it will be my primary measurement equipment in the lab until December, so this video project provides an excellent opportunity to further refine my skills and knowledge.\n  Subgoal 2: I need to make a video and have Christine look at it and approve it. It needs to be an easier project so I can start to confirm I’ve gotten some of the technical details and nuances of video production.\n  Subgoal 3: I need to understand lighting and recording on site in my lab to get the best video. This will require working more with Christine and fleshing out my ideas.\n  Subgoal 4: Work on off camera narration and footage. I will want to explain some of the physics principles and narrate them. Example “VSM employs Faraday’s law….VSM measures (among other things) Hysteresis loops   they are….etc.\n  Subgoal 5: Record one segment of the video, maybe scenes of mounting the sample to be included in the full 5 minute video.\n  Subgoal 6: Narrate a fast-forwarded hysteresis loop going over the various parts and why they are important to our magnetic characterization of materials.   ##### Achievable\nCan you reasonably accomplish the goal? Do you have the necessary skills or resources? What “data” will you use to measure your goal or to determine if it has been met?\n Yes, I think this is a reasonable goal as I will be working with the VSM frequently in the lab and I have good experienced people to both advise me and also give me feedback. I do not currently have the video production skills but I have Christine Boyland and I can benefit from her experience. She has also already introduced me to software and instructional videos. I Just need to watch them and apply their lessons in a tangible way.\n  ##### Relevant\nDoes this particular goal align with broader project or personal goals? How is the outcome important?    Absolutely, creating this video will not only deepen my understanding of the VSM—a crucial tool for characterizing our samples and unraveling their magnetic properties—but also pique my personal interest in video production. As a consumer of YouTube content, I’m excited to explore this medium, particularly to share my experiences as someone with ADHD and spatial reasoning challenges who has successfully pursued a PhD in physics. By sharing my journey, I hope to inspire others who might face similar obstacles. Ultimately, I aim to create a valuable resource for future lab members, as well as high school students curious about the hands-on reality of scientific research. This goal is important to me because I want to contribute to the growth and support of the next generation of scientists.\n\n\nTime Bound\nWhat is the time frame for accomplishing the goal? Is it realistic?    I would like the timeframe to be by the conclusion of our program DSGF but I can also try to make it by the end of December if that is too late. I think towards the end of DSGF is more realistic as I will be much more skilled and proficient (and confidant) in executing the VSM by then but I will also be working throughout the Fall primarily on VSM measurement and data analysis specifically (at least this is the current goal of my research advisor.)"

It’s a digital means of doing cartography. - ArcGIS: one of the most popular GIS platforms available. It is a paid service, but you have complimentary access at this link - ArcGIS will let you build several different types of maps using its component apps. Consult the presentations for information on how to use them: - StoryMaps: for narrative-driven mapping experiences where you want to guide users through information - Experience Builder: if you want to build your own app experience for users - Dashboard: for when you also want to display the underlying data in a map (e.g., how stats change over time0 - Instant Apps: if you want to use app tempaltes to create your user experience (e.g., creating an image gallery) - Once finished, you can use ArcGIS to publish your map. - Contact information and tutorials: look to the end of the presentation for this info! ## Review of Project Updates\n-Charlie - In a great place, as they’ve found geographic information on their sites and added it to a map within ArcGIS online. - Next steps involve upgrading to ArcGIS Pro to deal with overlapping labels and adding a layer showing pre-modern political boundaries. They haven’t found a map layer that provides the latter, so they may need to make it on their own using a polygon layer in ArcGIS. This may be another feature limited to ArcGIS Pro\n-Jennifer - She’s been distracted by a presentation proposal and personal matters. Jeff reminds her and Charlie that it’s okay if there projects need to put on pause or if goals need to be donwsized due to other things they have going on in their lives! - Tangible progress was made in other ways. Jennifer got measurements from the VSM and is almost done drafting the SOP that will inform her video on lab procedures. - Next steps will involve meeting with Chris Boyland from EAST about video production. ## Reminders and action items - [ ] Add your updates - November 21 - [ ] Prepare for next session - [ ] Install software - [ ] Text editor: Visual Studio Code - [ ] For a PC: install git bash using these instructions - [ ] Watch all 6 Code.org videos on how computers work if you haven’t already. - [ ] Optional: read “Hello, World” by Meredith Broussard (from Artificial Unintelligence, MIT 2018). NB: if direct link doesn’t work, use TriPod link - [ ] Send schedule for Spring 2026",

Command line workshop is scheduled for 12/3.\nOpening question: do Charlie & Jennifer have any questions about their logs?\n\nJennifer: does formatting matter?\n\nAnswer from Jeff: no, whatever works for the fellows is fine.\n\nBoth: questions about yaml formatting?\n\nAnswer from Alice: Yes! Make sure that it’s in the correct place in the markdown documents and that it is bracketed by “—” on both side.\n\nBoth: What is committing?\n\nAnswer from Jeff: we’ll cover what this means during the command line session, but for now, fellows should just think of it as Github’s version of “save.”\n\n\nProject management presentation\n\nSlides are in the program. Some project-specific ideas that were discussed:\n\nStakeholders: Jennifer has a pretty clear one in May Chang. Whatever is produced needs to have her sign-off, so she should be consulted through the project.\nStakeholders: Charlie & Jennifer should remember to consider their own thoughts and capacity while planning.\nExtra details: Alice uses a slighlty modified version of the project charter Jeff shared out. Extra topics included in it credit and attribution—who is listed as a project creatore and how materials are shared (default is open source)—and preservation (who will maintain the project and for how long).\n\n\nReviewing Charlie & Jennifer’s learning plans\n\nOverall: these are really good! Both fellows have ironed out the key steps in their project through making SMART goals.\nMinor feedback points:\n\nJennifer: Depending on time, she should see if there are ways for her to do user testing (e.g., with high school students at local schools), supposing she has the time. She may also want to see if there are ways to collect viewing data in YouTube before the end of the project (Jeff).\nCharlie: Biggest issue might be getting map layers. The trickiest will be finding one that shows contemporary political borders for the sites in the project. They’ll need to decide if that’s something they want to spend time learning, or if it should be cut out in order to generate a MVP (Alice & Jeff)\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\nReview project management\nDiscuss learning plans\nMarkdown stuff\n\n\n\nProject management\n\nToday’s Presentation from Jeff\nBlank versions of EAST Project Charter: make use of this if your want to.",

I was able to locate two of these monasteries on Google Maps without much trouble. Another monastery, named Getesmani Maryam, was mentioned in some academic publications, but proved difficult to find on Google Maps. Luckily, the Encyclopedia Aethiopica entry for Getesmani Maryam included coordinates: 11.10 N, 38.4 E. The last monastery, called Dabra Jamado Maryam, proved more illusive. I eventually determined that “Jamado” is an alternate transliteration of ዠመዱ, which is often instead transliterated as Žämmädu. (When the icons were first published in the early 70s, there was no standard system for transliterating Amharic and other Ethiopic languages.) I was able to find the location of Žämmädu Maryam on Google Maps.\n\n\n\nWith the locations of my monasteries finalized, I gathered the location data in a spreadsheet. I also included location data for the place of production of the icons (Candia/Herklion, Crete) and other sites that they may have treveled to before reaching Ethiopia. For each site, I included a column to specify whether the icons were known to have been at the site, or whether the connection is speculative. I then used this data to generate a map with ArcGIS online. I used conditional styling so that the known sites appeared in green and the speculative sites in yellow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, if sites are too close together, their labels do not appear. After some searching online, I think I’ve determined that there is no good workaround to this in ArcGIS online, but Pro has features that allow for overlapping labels.\n\n\n\nI want to give my viewer a sense of the geopolitical boundaries that existed in this period (early 16th century), but these boundaries were unstable and in flux. I also have not been able to find a satisfactory map of 16th century Ethiopia, although I will continue searching. I will likely map these boundaries myself, with a polygon layer.

Christine has kindly shared her expertise on video storytelling and showed me some techiques through WeVideo so far. Furthermore, I have the benefit of a diverse lab community consisting of individuals with varying age ranges and educational backgrounds—including undergraduates and graduates—who I believe would be willing to offer their feedback as well.\nIf this is a long term goal, what milestones (or sub-goals) will you need to meet on the way to achieving it? What “data” will you use to measure your goal or to determine if it has been met?\n  Subgoal 1: Before proceeding with the video, I will ensure that my advisor approves the Standard Operating Procedure I’ve been developing. This document incorporates helpful visuals and critical information but still requires some refinement. Obtaining my advisor’s feedback will guarantee that I am accurately demonstrating each step and setting a strong example for viewers. Although I’m still fairly new to operating the VSM, it will be my primary measurement equipment in the lab until December, so this video project provides an excellent opportunity to further refine my skills and knowledge.\n  Subgoal 2: I need to make a video and have Christine look at it and approve it. It needs to be an easier project so I can start to confirm I’ve gotten some of the technical details and nuances of video production.\n  Subgoal 3: I need to understand lighting and recording on site in my lab to get the best video. This will require working more with Christine and fleshing out my ideas.\n  Subgoal 4: Work on off camera narration and footage. I will want to explain some of the physics principles and narrate them. Example “VSM employs Faraday’s law….VSM measures (among other things) Hysteresis loops   they are….etc.\n  Subgoal 5: Record one segment of the video, maybe scenes of mounting the sample to be included in the full 5 minute video.\n  Subgoal 6: Narrate a fast-forwarded hysteresis loop going over the various parts and why they are important to our magnetic characterization of materials.   ##### Achievable\nCan you reasonably accomplish the goal? Do you have the necessary skills or resources? What “data” will you use to measure your goal or to determine if it has been met?\n Yes, I think this is a reasonable goal as I will be working with the VSM frequently in the lab and I have good experienced people to both advise me and also give me feedback. I do not currently have the video production skills but I have Christine Boyland and I can benefit from her experience. She has also already introduced me to software and instructional videos. I Just need to watch them and apply their lessons in a tangible way.\n  ##### Relevant\nDoes this particular goal align with broader project or personal goals? How is the outcome important?    Absolutely, creating this video will not only deepen my understanding of the VSM—a crucial tool for characterizing our samples and unraveling their magnetic properties—but also pique my personal interest in video production. As a consumer of YouTube content, I’m excited to explore this medium, particularly to share my experiences as someone with ADHD and spatial reasoning challenges who has successfully pursued a PhD in physics. By sharing my journey, I hope to inspire others who might face similar obstacles. Ultimately, I aim to create a valuable resource for future lab members, as well as high school students curious about the hands-on reality of scientific research. This goal is important to me because I want to contribute to the growth and support of the next generation of scientists.\n\n\nTime Bound\nWhat is the time frame for accomplishing the goal? Is it realistic?    I would like the timeframe to be by the conclusion of our program DSGF but I can also try to make it by the end of December if that is too late. I think towards the end of DSGF is more realistic as I will be much more skilled and proficient (and confidant) in executing the VSM by then but I will also be working throughout the Fall primarily on VSM measurement and data analysis specifically (at least this is the current goal of my research advisor.)"
